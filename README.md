This project is based on the following Kaggle competition: 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/loan-default-pred/data 

Due to problems with Kaggle's test data file, we used only the training data set which is available in this git and called "loan_default.csv". We trained and tested the model on this single data file. 

The complete model code and its statistical outputs are available in this RPub publication:
